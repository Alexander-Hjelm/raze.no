## A few places to start:
- Add more pages by creating json block files in the project root directory. Use **index.json** as an example.
- Change the page contents by editing the markdown files in the **markdown/** folder
- Change the stylesheet of this page by changing the file: **stylesheets/index.css**
- Add html snippets in **html-snippets/** to insert custom html code in a page
